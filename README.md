## Purpose & Overview

This project focuses on predicting obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions. Our goal is to identify the key factors that contribute to obesity and provide actionable insights for public health or wellness programs.

**Business Problem:**  
We aim to advise public health professionals and wellness program designers on which eating habits and physical features are most predictive of obesity, enabling targeted interventions and lifestyle recommendations.

**Dataset:**  
The dataset contains the following variables for individuals:

- Age
- Gender
- Height
- Weight
- BMI
- Eating habits (e.g., fast food consumption, fruit/vegetable intake)
- Physical activity level
- Water consumption
- Smoking habits
- Other lifestyle factors
- Target: Obesity level (e.g., Insufficient, Normal, Overweight, Obesity Type I/II/III)
