## Purpose & Overview

This project focuses on **exploring and visualizing obesity trends** based on eating habits, physical activity, and demographic factors. Our goal is to uncover patterns that contribute to different obesity levels and communicate insights through **clear, data-driven visualizations**.

**Business Question:**  
What relationships exist between lifestyle habits, demographic factors, and obesity levels, and how can visualizations help uncover meaningful patterns in this population?

**Dataset:**  
UCI Obesity Dataset – "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition."  
Variables include:
- Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI
- Eating habits (e.g., fast food, fruit/vegetable intake)
- Physical activity, water consumption, smoking habits
- Target: Obesity Level (Insufficient, Normal, Overweight, Obesity Type I/II/III)

## Goals & Objectives

- Explore distributions of numeric and categorical variables  
- Visualize relationships between lifestyle factors and obesity levels  
- Detect outliers and inconsistencies in the dataset  
- Create a **reproducible, insight-driven visualization report**  
- Communicate findings for public health and wellness interventions

## Techniques & Tools

- **Languages & Tools:** Python 3, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (optional), scipy  
- **Preprocessing Steps:**  
  - Standardize categorical variables  
  - Ensure numeric variables have correct datatypes  
  - Handle missing values (if any)  
  - Remove duplicates  
- **Visualization Techniques:**  
  - Countplots for categorical variables and target distribution  
  - Histograms & KDE plots for numeric features  
  - Boxplots & Violinplots for feature comparison by obesity level  
  - FacetGrids for multi-category comparisons  
  - Correlation Heatmaps for numeric variables  
  - Pairplots for selected numeric features  
- **Purpose:** Create reproducible, insightful, and presentation-ready visualizations of obesity trends
